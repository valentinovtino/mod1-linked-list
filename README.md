# mod1-linked-list


Linked list is the first pair project in Mod 1 front end at Turing. I worked with Valentino Valentin.

The project is a url bookmarking site. The user can enter a title and url and it is posted on the page. Once posted a bookmark can be marked read or removed. There is also a clear read button that removes all bookmarks marked as read. It's responsive in google chrome.
This project is written in jQuery.



I have forked this repository for refactoring/implementing feedback/expanding on the original project.
